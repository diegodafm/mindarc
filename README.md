# Mindarc

Just a simple implementation from template located in docs folder.

The main purpose of this project is: expose my abilities in touch with Bootstrap to create a single responsive page covering some important tags in HTML5 with CSS3.

Although wasn't required to use pre-processor of CSS, but I wanted expose a few technologies I'm dealing with everyday, which involves Grunt, Express, Node JS, SASS, etc.

Is not required to run any command to run the application, just clone then open the index.html file on your favority web browser and you might see it running. 

The reason I've committed the dist files and vendors, is just to avoid extra works to test out.
If you want to run the app locally, just follow the instructions and you will be good.
