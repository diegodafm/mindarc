# Mindarc

Just a simple implementation from template located in docs folder.

The main purpose of this project is: expose my abilities in touch with Bootstrap to create a single responsive page covering some important tags in HTML5 with CSS3.

Although wasn't required to use pre-processor of CSS, but I wanted expose a few technologies I'm dealing with everyday, which involves Grunt, Express, Node JS, SASS, etc.
